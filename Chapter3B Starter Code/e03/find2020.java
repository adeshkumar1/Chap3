/**
 * Specifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 
 * and then multiply those two numbers together.

For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:
1721
979
366
299
675
1456
In this list, the two entries that sum to 2020 are 1721 and 299. 
Multiplying them together produces 1721 * 299 = 514579, 
so the correct answer is 514579.

Of course, your expense report is much larger. 
Find the two entries that sum to 2020; 
what do you get if you multiply them together?
